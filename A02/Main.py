# 4. Select one host and run ping to all other hosts. Record the latencies.
# 5. Compute a VLB routing strategy. For each source-destination pair, first route traffic from the source
# to a random switch, and then from that switch to the destination.
# 6. Use the Ryu controller to configure the switches with the VLB forwarding rules.
# 7. Select the same host as in step 4 and run ping to all other hosts.
# 8. Because VLB is randomized, repeat steps 5â€“7 several times with different choices of random intermediate nodes. Record the average of the latencies across all runs.
# 9. Produce a bar chart, comparing the shortest path latency to the VLB latency for each destination.
